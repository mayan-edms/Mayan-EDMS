"A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this site can "
"serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header attacks, which"
" are possible even under many seemingly-safe web server configurations. "
"Values in this list can be fully qualified names (e.g. 'www.example.com'), "
"in which case they will be matched against the request's Host header exactly"
" (case-insensitive, not including port). A value beginning with a period can"
" be used as a subdomain wildcard: '.example.com' will match example.com, "
"www.example.com, and any other subdomain of example.com. A value of '*' will"
" match anything; in this case you are responsible to provide your own "
"validation of the Host header (perhaps in a middleware; if so this "
"middleware must be listed first in MIDDLEWARE)."

"When set to True, if the request URL does not match any of the patterns in "

"submitted in a POST request to be lost. The APPEND_SLASH setting is only "

"Default: 2621440 (i.e. 2.5 MB). The maximum size in bytes that a request "

"against the total request size excluding any file upload data. You can set "
"this to None to disable the check. Applications that are expected to receive"
" unusually large form posts should tune this setting. The amount of request "
"data is correlated to the amount of memory needed to process the request and"
" populate the GET and POST dictionaries. Large requests could be used as a "
"denial-of-service attack vector if left unchecked. Since web servers don't "
