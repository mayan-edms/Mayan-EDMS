"A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this site can "
"serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header attacks, which"
" are possible even under many seemingly-safe web server configurations. "
"Values in this list can be fully qualified names (e.g. 'www.example.com'), "
"in which case they will be matched against the request's Host header exactly"
" (case-insensitive, not including port). A value beginning with a period can"
" be used as a subdomain wildcard: '.example.com' will match example.com, "
"www.example.com, and any other subdomain of example.com. A value of '*' will"
" match anything; in this case you are responsible to provide your own "
"validation of the Host header (perhaps in a middleware; if so this "
