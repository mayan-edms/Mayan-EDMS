"A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this site can "

"in which case they will be matched against the request's Host header exactly "
"(case-insensitive, not including port). A value beginning with a period can "
"be used as a subdomain wildcard: '.example.com' will match example.com, www."
"example.com, and any other subdomain of example.com. A value of '*' will "

"Default: 2621440 (i.e. 2.5 MB). The maximum size in bytes that a request "

"check is done when accessing request.body or request.POST and is calculated "
"against the total request size excluding any file upload data. You can set "
"this to None to disable the check. Applications that are expected to receive "
"unusually large form posts should tune this setting. The amount of request "
"data is correlated to the amount of memory needed to process the request and "
"populate the GET and POST dictionaries. Large requests could be used as a "
"denial-of-service attack vector if left unchecked. Since web servers don't "
