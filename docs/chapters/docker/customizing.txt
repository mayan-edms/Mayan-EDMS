=====================
Customizing the image
=====================

If you just need to add a few Ubuntu or Python packages to your installation,
you can use the following environment variables:

``MAYAN_APT_INSTALLS``

Specifies a list of Ubuntu .deb packages to be installed via APT when the
container is first created. The installed packages are not lost when the image
is stopped. Example: To install the Tesseract OCR language packs for German
and Spanish add the following in your ``docker start`` command line::

    -e MAYAN_APT_INSTALLS="tesseract-ocr-deu tesseract-ocr-spa"

``MAYAN_PIP_INSTALLS``

Specifies a list of Python packages to be installed via ``pip``. Packages will
be downloaded from the Python Package Index (https://pypi.python.org) by
default.
