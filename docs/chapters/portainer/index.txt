From the Portainer website:

    Portainer is a Universal Container Management System for Kubernetes,
    Docker/Swarm, and Nomad that simplifies container operations so you can
    deliver software to more places, faster


By default, the entire software stack is deployed as a single container. This
provides an easy way to get started and will be sufficient for several
thousand documents.


.. note::

   Portainer installations are not officially supported and are meant
   for small/personal/demo installations. This might change as the body of
   knowledge regarding the Portainer system increases.
