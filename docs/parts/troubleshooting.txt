MySQL error: ``Incorrect string value: `'xE2x80x95rs6…'` for column `'content'` at row 1``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using MySQL and doing OCR on languages other than English

Use utf-8 collation on MySQL server, or at least in table
‘documents_documentpage', ‘content' field

Solution:
Convert all MySQL tables to the same type, either all MyISAM or InnoDB


PostgreSQL error: ``OperationalError: FATAL:  sorry, too many clients already``

Set ``MAYAN_DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE`` to 0

This setting keeps a database connection alive. It allows reuse of database
connections. When Mayan EDMS is deployed with Gunicorn a microthreads backend,
the database connections are not shared and this setting has the reverse effect
of exhausting the available PostgreSQL connections available. To avoid this,
Setting ``MAYAN_DATABASE_CONN_MAX_AGE`` to 0 will cause all microthreads to
release their connections, by closing them when finished.

MySQL error: ``ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for actstream_follow(user_id, content_type_id, object_id)``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is caused by a bug in Django 1.11. The issue has been fixed for Django 2.0
version which Mayan EDMS will be migrating to for version 4.0.

Mitigation:
Avoid MySQL versions: 8.0.x. Use MySQL 5.7 or earlier.

Docker
======

RabbitMQ is not being persisting messages despite using Docker Volumes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker will create a randomly generated hostname for each container every
time you deploy a new container instance.

RabbitMQ stores persistent message/queue data using a folder structure
based off a node's hostname.
If you do not set a static container hostname, then RabbitMQ will loose
any unprocessed messages if you launch a new RabbitMQ container or
do a docker-compose down/up.

This happens even if you use a persistent volume (``docker run -v``).

This will result in tasks being lost and may be the reason a document has
not been OCR'd or processed completely.

Solution:
Ensure you run the RabbitMQ container with the ``--hostname`` option when
starting, ensuring RabbitMQ uses a static folder name every time it starts,
such as:

``docker run -d --name mayan-rabbitmq --hostname mayan-rabbitmq --restart=always...``

For Docker Compose::

    rabbitmq:
        container_name: mayan-edms-rabbitmq
        image: rabbitmq:3-management
        hostname: mayan-edms-rabbitmq
        environment:
        RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: mayan
        RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: mayanrabbitpass
        RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST: mayan
        networks:
        - mayan-bridge
        restart: unless-stopped
        volumes:
        - /docker-volumes/mayan-edms/rabbitmq:/var/lib/rabbitmq

MAYAN_APT_INSTALLS does not work for Archlinux with kernels > 4.14
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is caused by a change from kernel 4.18 - 4.19. Metacopy on these kernels
is set to yes in archlinux kernels (/sys/module/overlay/parameters/metacopy)
and overlayfs should override this which it does not at the moment.

The workaround is to disable metacopy::

    echo N | sudo tee /sys/module/overlay/parameters/metacopy

Error: ``IOError: [Errno 37] No locks available`` when using a NFS volume for $MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is caused by an upstream Django issue and occurrs when using a NFS volume for $MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT.
File lock issues can prevent mayan from generating the static media inside $MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT.

If you're using NFSv3, ensure that rcp.statd is running on the NFS client (called nfs-lock on some distributions)
and that ``no_auth_nlm`` is set in ``/etc/exports`` on the NFS Server.
NFSv4 has locking built in so does not require rcp.statd, but may require ``no_auth_nlm`` set on the NFS Server.

A workaround if the issue persists after applying the above is to deploy Mayan with a NFS $MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT with
a local-only volume for $MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT/static. An example volume section inside docker-compose::

    volumes:
    # $MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT can be mounted to nfs and shared between nodes. Change /mnt/mayan-shared
    # to the path of the mounted NFS export
    - /mnt/mayan-shared/media:/var/lib/mayan

    # $MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT/static must be local to avoid locking issues
    - /docker-volume/static:/var/lib/mayan/static

    # Other mounts (such as watch folder). Must be on a different NFS export to avoid lock issues
    - /mnt/watch:/srv/watch_folder

Alternatively, you can use non-NFS backed volumes for the whole $MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT share where no local
static directory is required. Samba and iSCSI are known to work.

LDAP
====

If you get a ``No module named 'ldap.filter'`` error when starting Mayan EDMS
after enabling LDAP, make sure your LDAP settings module is not using
the same name as a Python or Django library. Instead of using ``ldap.py`` for
your settings module, use something like ``ldaplogin.py``.

Passwords
=========

.. _troubleshooting-admin-password:

Admin password reset
--------------------

To reset the password of the admin account use the following command::

    MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=<your Mayan media root setting> <installation directory>/bin/mayan-edms.py changepassword admin

If you followed the deploying instructions from the documentation your
``MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT`` will be ``|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT|``.

If using a Docker image, execute the command inside the container. First you
need to know the name of the Docker container running Mayan EDMS on your setup
with::

    docker ps

Then execute the password reset command inside the Docker container::

    docker exec -ti <your docker container name> |MAYAN_BIN| changepassword admin

Another way to do this is to execute a shell inside the container to get a
command prompt::

    docker exec -ti <your docker container name> /bin/bash

And then execute the command::

    |MAYAN_BIN| changepassword admin


.. _troubleshooting-autoadmin-account:

Missing automatic admin account after installation
--------------------------------------------------

This is caused when the ``initialsetup`` command is interrupted as the admin
user is created outside of the database migrations.

To create an admin super user account manually use the command::

    MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| |MAYAN_BIN| createsuperuser

If you followed the deploying instructions from the documentation your
``MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT`` will be ``|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT|``.

If using a Docker image, execute the command inside the container. First
find you container name with::

    docker ps

Then execute the command inside the container::

    docker exec -ti <your docker container name> |MAYAN_BIN| createsuperuser

Another way to do this is to execute a shell inside the container to get a
command prompt::

    docker exec -ti <your docker container name> /bin/bash

And then execute the command::

    |MAYAN_BIN| createsuperuser


Python
======

How to upgrade an existing Python 2 virtualenv
----------------------------------------------

Use::

    virtualenv <existing directory> -p <Python 3 binary path>

If you followed the deployment instructions, the command line would be::

    virtualenv /opt/mayan-edms -p /usr/bin/python3

If using a dedicated user account for Mayan EDMS::

    sudo -u mayan virtualenv --clear /opt/mayan-edms -p /usr/bin/python3


Watchfolders
============

Incomplete files uploaded
-------------------------

To avoid uploading files are they are being copied to the watchfolder, copy the
files to a temporary directory on the same partition as the watchfolder first.
Then move the files to the watchfolder. The move will be executed as an atomic
operation and will prevent the files to be uploaded in the middle of the
copying process.


The watched folder feature is not working
-----------------------------------------

Make sure that the Celery BEAT scheduler is running correctly as it is the
element that triggers the periodic tasks. Check that the user running the Mayan
EDMS services has read and write permissions for the watch folder.


Dependencies
============

Error: ``unable to execute 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc': No such file or directory``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This happens when using the ``MAYAN_APT_INSTALLS`` feature. It means that the
``GCC`` package is required to compile the packages specified with
``MAYAN_APT_INSTALLS``.

Solution: Include ``gcc`` in the list of packages specified with ``MAYAN_APT_INSTALLS``.


Static files
============

Mayan EDMS installed correctly and works, but static files are not served
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Django's development server doesn't serve static files unless the DEBUG option
is set to True, this mode of operation should only be used for development or
testing. For production deployments the management command::

    $ mayan-edms.py preparestatic

should be used and the resulting static folder served from a webserver.
For more information check the
:django-docs:`howto/static-files/`


Text encoding
=============

Error: ``UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position ...``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operating system locale must support the Unicode character set. For Debian
base distributions, modify the locale file ``/etc/default/locale``:

    LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"



Other
=====

File system links not showing when serving content with ``Samba``
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Disable unix extensions in the [global] section and enable wide links for the file serving share

Example::

    [global]
        unix extensions = no

        ...

    [digitalizacion]
        path = /var/local/mayan
        guest ok = yes
        read only = yes
        wide links = yes
        follow symlinks = yes
