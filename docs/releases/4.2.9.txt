Version 4.2.9
=============

Released: August 4, 2022

Status: Maintenance


Changes
-------


Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The impersonation app template caching was disabled. This ensures
the impersonation banner is triggered correctly in all edge cases where
multiple frontend processes or load balancers are used.


Settings
^^^^^^^^

The settings app templates caching was disabled. Just like the impersonation
app, this ensures correct functionality of the settings change
banner in all edge cases.


Sources
^^^^^^^

Permission filtering was added the source switch links. This change is only
visual and does not affect the functionality of the sources.

The permission filtering for the links is the same as the views: The
document create permission is required for the source links during document
uploads and the document file new permissions is required for the source
links in the new document file upload view.


Other
^^^^^

Added make file development targets ``setup-dev-operating-system-packages``
and ``setup-dev-python-libraries``.
