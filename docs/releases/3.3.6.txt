Version 3.3.6
=============

Released: December 19, 2019


Changes
-------


Compressed files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Zip files only support UTF-8 and CP437 encoding for filenames. This is not
strongly enforce and some software creates zip files with other text
encoding. The ZipArchive class was updated to work with badly encoded
filenames instead of raising an error.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

The page count code was updated to work with more versions of PDF files.
A Python 3 incompatibility was also fixed.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

The PDF orientation detection was fixed and updated to work with the new
converter layer system.


Redis
^^^^^

The Redis lock backend initialization was updated to allow it to also work
with Redis versions older than 5.0.


Security
^^^^^^^^

A fix for a cross site scripting issues was removed by accident during a
version merge at some unknown time. The fix was reapplied and more robust
tests using Selenium added to avoid further regressions.


Settings
^^^^^^^^

FreeBSD is now also detected and the paths of binaries adjusted for easier
installation.


Sources
^^^^^^^

A issue that left behind periodic task entries for watch folders after
deleting a document type associated with them was fixed.

Transaction handling was added to the interval sources base class delete
and save methods. This increases protection against data loss on database
failure.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last update for the user interface planned for series 3.3 is included.
This update makes the list toolbar "stick" to the top of the view when
scrolling. This is the new toolbar that encloses the multi-item action menu
and the pagination controls.

The usage of the incorrect word "overrided" was updated to "overridden".

The address used to check for new versions was updated to the new
Python Package Index address. This avoids SSL certificate errors when the old
certificate is reused.


Removals

- None


Upgrading process
-----------------

#. Stop supervisord::

    sudo systemctl stop supervisor


Upgrading from Mayan EDMS 3.2.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Update the Redis configuration:

   Configure Redis to discard data when it runs out of memory, not save its
   database, and only keep 2 database:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo echo "maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru" >> /etc/redis/redis.conf
       sudo echo "save \"\"" >> /etc/redis/redis.conf
       sudo echo "databases 2" >> /etc/redis/redis.conf
       sudo systemctl restart redis


#. Install the Python 3 development OS package:

   .. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev


#. Update the virtualenv to use Python 3:

   .. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u mayan virtualenv --clear /opt/mayan-edms -p /usr/bin/python3


#. Create a home directory for the Mayan EDMS system user:

   .. code-block:: bash

    mkdir /home/mayan


#. Grant ownership to the Mayan EDMS system user:

   .. code-block:: bash

    chown mayan:mayan /home/mayan

#. Reinstall the Python client for PostgreSQL and Redis:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u mayan |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| install --no-use-pep517 psycopg2==|PYTHON_PSYCOPG2_VERSION| redis==|PYTHON_REDIS_VERSION|

   .. note::

       Platforms with the ARM CPU might also need additional requirements:

       .. code-block:: bash

           sudo -u mayan |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| install --no-use-pep517 psutil==|PYTHON_PSUTIL_VERSION|


#. Reinstall the Python client for RabbitMQ if you are using RabbitMQ as a broker:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u mayan |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| install --no-use-pep517 amqp==|PYTHON_AMQP_VERSION|


Upgrade steps from any previous version of Mayan EDMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Remove deprecated requirements:

   .. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u mayan curl |SOURCE_CODE_REPOSITORY|raw/master/removals.txt -o /tmp/removals.txt \
    && sudo -u mayan |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| uninstall -y -r /tmp/removals.txt


#. Update the Mayan EDMS Python package:

   .. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u mayan |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| install mayan-edms==3.3.6

   the requirements will also be updated automatically.


#. Make a backup of your supervisord file:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo cp |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF| |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|.bck


#. Update the supervisord configuration file. Replace the environment
   variables values show here with your respective settings. This step will refresh
   the supervisord configuration file with the new queues and the latest
   recommended layout:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u mayan MAYAN_DATABASE_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql MAYAN_DATABASE_NAME=mayan \
       MAYAN_DATABASE_PASSWORD=mayanuserpass MAYAN_DATABASE_USER=mayan \
       MAYAN_DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1 MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| platformtemplate supervisord | sudo sh -c "cat > |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|"

   or:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u mayan MAYAN_DATABASES=\"{'default':{'ENGINE':'django.db.backends.postgresql','NAME':'mayan','PASSWORD':'mayanuserpass','USER':'mayan','HOST':'127.0.0.1'}}\" \
       MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| platformtemplate supervisord | sudo sh -c "cat > |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|"


#. Edit the supervisord configuration file and update any setting specific to your installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo vi |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|


#. Migrate existing database schema with:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u mayan MAYAN_DATABASE_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql MAYAN_DATABASE_NAME=mayan \
       MAYAN_DATABASE_PASSWORD=mayanuserpass MAYAN_DATABASE_USER=mayan \
       MAYAN_DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1 MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| performupgrade

   or:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u mayan MAYAN_DATABASES="{'default':{'ENGINE':'django.db.backends.postgresql','NAME':'mayan','PASSWORD':'mayanuserpass','USER':'mayan','HOST':'127.0.0.1'}}" \
       MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
      |MAYAN_BIN| performupgrade


#. Add new static media:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo -u mayan MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| preparestatic --noinput


#. Start supervisord:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo systemctl start supervisor


The upgrade procedure is now complete.
