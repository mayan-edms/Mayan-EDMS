Version 4.1.8
=============

Released: April 23, 2022

Status: End of life

Changes
-------


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update Django from version 2.2.24 to 2.2.28.


Mailing
^^^^^^^

Updated the ``subject`` and ``body`` fields of the document email
workflow action to be optional.

The ``WorkflowAction`` added an official way to migrate old workflow actions.
This this method to migrate existing ``EmailAction`` workflow actions. This
removes the need to a subclass and avoids a double entry in the workflow
state action selection dropdown.


Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^

Several patches were backported for the partial navigation code used to
implement the single page app behavior. The URL provided for redirection
after POST actions is now processed and cleaned up instead of being used
as-is. Dead code and repeated logic was unified along with some JavaScript
ES6 updates.

The custom status code used for AJAX redirection is now configurable via the
``APPEARANCE_AJAX_REDIRECTION_CODE`` settings. The default value of the
setting is 278 to retain backward compatibility.


Search
^^^^^^

The search model reference used for the search view and API are now unified
and well defined using new ``SEARCH_MODEL_NAME_KWARG`` constant.

The search model attribute to be passed to the search view and API is the
primary key (``pk``) and not the name.


Sentry
^^^^^^

The default Sentry client ``traces_sample_rate`` was reduced from 0.25 to
0.05.


Source
^^^^^^

Improvement to the new document link condition logic we backported from the
4.2 branch. These changes ensure that the new document and file links access
work like their respective views. The links will be active only when the
access is granted for the source as well as the document/document type.


Other
^^^^^
