Version 4.2
===========

Released: February 12, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authentication app was refactored to add several major changes.
The first major change was adding support for multi factor authentication.
The implementation builds on top of Django's authentication code to provide
a secure but at the same time extensible framework with features such as
unlimited number of authentication factors and forms for login.

With the addition of multi factor authentication, it was possible to add
two step authentication using time based one time password (TOTP) was added.
This implementation works in a very similar as most implementations where
a random secret is generated and presented as a QR code that is scanned using
mobile apps or hardware tokens. During the next login, a token representing
the secret will be required to complete the login process.

TOTP authentication can be disabled at anytime either by the user or by an
administrator. This can be done via the user interface or via new management
commands.

These commands are:

- ``authentication_otp_disable`` disable OTP authentication for a user
- ``authentication_otp_initialize`` initialize the OTP state data for
  all users. This command is for debuging and maintenance in case the
  database migration does not correctly initialize the OTP state data
  for existing users.
- ``authentication_otp_status`` display the OTP status of a user

The new authentication app allows for the easy creation of authentication
workflows via backends. These are classes passed via the setting
``AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND``, which must be the dotted path
to the backend used to process user authentication and
``AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS`` which is an optional YAML structure
to pass to the authentication backend.

The authentication backends are able to control and customize the entire
login process, including the forms presented to the user. Authentication
backends can use mixins and can be subclassed to mix and expand their
capabilities.

Included authentication mixins:
- ``AuthenticationBackendRememberMeMixin``

Included authentication backends:
- ``AuthenticationBackendModelDjangoDefault``
- ``AuthenticationBackendModelEmailPassword``
- ``AuthenticationBackendModelUsernamePassword``

Apps define authentication backends in the module
``authentication_backends.py``.

With this new system the old ``EmailAuthBackend`` authentication class is
removed. The same function is now accomplished by the
``AuthenticationBackendModelEmailPassword`` backend.

To enable TOTP authentication, set ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND`` to
``mayan.apps.authentication_otp.authentication_backends.AuthenticationBackendModelUsernamePasswordTOTP``
for username and TOTP login. For email and TOTP logins use
``mayan.apps.authentication_otp.authentication_backends.AuthenticationBackendModelEmailPasswordTOTP``.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Django 2.2 is approaching end of life status, as such this version used
Django 3.2 with the next LTS release and will be supported until 2024.

Other packages were updated:

- django-widget-tweaks from version 1.4.8 to 1.4.9.
- psycopg2 from version 2.8.6 to 2.9.2.
- redis client from version 3.5.3 to 4.0.2.

The default version of PostgreSQL is now 12.9. Follow the required database
procedure to migrate your data from the existing version to the new default
version. This process requires creating a dump of your existing data and then
importing it to the new version.


Docker
^^^^^^

The ``.env`` and ``env_file`` were unified as a single ``.env`` file. Ensure
you copy any custom changes your existing ``env_file`` before updating your
deployment.

The internal Docker network used for the deployment was renamed from
``bridge`` to ``mayan``. This helps differentiate the network now that
multiple networks are supported.

The Docker Compose was moved from Debian 10 slim to Debian 11 slim. The build
image was moved from Python 3.8-slim to Python 3.11-slim.

The command ``run_initialsetup_or_performupgrade`` was added to facilitate
installations and upgrades in custom Docker deployments.

The default Docker Compose was updated to support more customization. The
Redis container is now controlled by its own profile, this allows using
external Redis servers is desired.

The deployment now defaults to using RabbitMQ a the message broker.

The RabbitMQ image tag was changed from 3.9-alpine to 3.9-management-alpine.
This image includes the management plugins which aid in debugging and
optimization of custom deployments.

The Traefik configuration was improved and supports more options.
Additionally, the Traefik profile now runs in its own Docker network.

A Docker Compose password randomizer script is now available.

The necessary LDAP libraries and Python modules are now included in the
default Docker image. User wanting to use LDAP still need to create a custom
settings file but do not need to install the LDAP libraries or worry about
dependency conflicts anymore.


Error logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The error logger now includes a global error log list view in the tool menu.
This view will display error log messages for all objects in the system that
have been converted to the unified error logger.


Mailing
^^^^^^^

The events "mailing profile created" and "mailing profile edited" were
added, enable as workflow triggers and for subscription.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

A regular expression metadata validator and parser were addeed. These
offer unlimited verification of user input and transformation of user input.

Support for passing arguments to the metadata validators and parsers
was added.

The model field used to store the path to the parser and validator was
extended to 224 characters.


MIME types
^^^^^^^^^^

Support for MIME type detection backends was added. This feature allows
customizing the MIME type detection. Additionally, arguments can be passed
to the MIME type backends for things like hardcoding file magic numbers for
esoteric file types.

The previous MIME type detection code which used the Python Magic library is
now the default backend.

In addition to the default backend two new backends were added:

- PERL ``mimetype`` backend.
- Linux ``file`` command line binary backend.


REST API
^^^^^^^^

The batch API feature was updated to add support for binary content. Binary
content is now returned in the response as a base64 encoded string.

Support for dynamic field API serialization was added. This feature allows
specifying which fields are to be included in the response. This can be done
by specifying which fields to include or which to exclude.

To support dynamic API fields, two URL query keys were added. These keys are
``_fields_only`` and ``_fields_exclude``. Nested objects are supported using
the double underscore (``__``) separator.

The serialized first page of each document version and document file is now
included in the serialized document object. This helps reduce API requests
when attempting to display document thumbnails via the API.

For objects that are children objects, the parent object IDs are now added
to the serializer. The layout is ``{parent object name}_id``. A few objects
already provided the parent ID but with a different schema. These objects
also now have the parent ID field with the new schema even if it displays
a duplicate value. The old ID field is now deprecated and will be removed
in version 5.0.


Search
^^^^^^

The Whoosh backend has been completed and is now the default search engine
backend.

The search indexing code was improve and now all object fields are indexed
on creation, update or deletion.

Several management commands were added. These are:

  - ``search_index_objects`` to trigger the queuing of search models from
    the CLI.
  - ``search_status`` to show indexing status of the search backend.
  - ``search_initialize`` and ``search_upgrade``. These are called
    automatically after the initial setup and after upgrades, but were added
    to aid in maintenance.

Add new settings called ``SEARCH_INDEXING_CHUNK_SIZE`` was added to allow
setting the number of objects to prepare when performing bulk search
indexing.

In addition to the Whoosh search backend, support was also added for
ElasticSearch.

A new queue was added called ``search_slow`` for the long running tasks of
search indexing.


Sources
^^^^^^^

The sources that provide thumbnails now do so using the unified image serving
code from the converter app. In addition to reducing duplicated code, the
sources app also benefits from the improvements in image serving from the
converter app like the adoption of ``StreamingHttpResponse`` to serve
previews as streamed responses and allowing showing previews for office
documents in the staging folders.

Support was added for inclusion and exclusion regular expressions for watch
folders.


Storage
^^^^^^^

Two new settings were added to allow controlling the interval at which
expired download files and shared uploaded files are cleaned up. These
are:

  - ``DOWNLOAD_FILE_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL`` which defaults to 2 days.
  - ``SHARED_UPLOADED_FILE_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL`` which defaults to 7 days.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All user menu entries were reorganized to be located under a "User details"
link.

Support was added for editing the locale profile of users as well as the
theme settings.

Internally, the views for users, current users and superusers were unified
resulting in a reduction of code, easier maintenance, and made the user
view easier to extend.

New user events named "User theme edited" and "User locale profile edited"
were added events.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

The workflow template transitions were exposed via the API.

Support was added for launching workflows from the API.

A small change was made to the workflow template permissions to require
the view permission instead of the edit permission when attempting to view
child objects of a workflow template.

The workflow state now has a column displaying all created actions labels
separated by a comma.

Removals
--------

- None


Upgrade process
---------------

.. important::

  If using a direct deployment, Supervisord must be upgraded to version
  4.2.2. See troubleshooting section: :ref:`troubleshooting-version-4.1`


.. include:: partials/upgrade-3.5-4.0.txt


Troubleshooting
---------------

Follow the solutions outlined in the troubleshooting section:
:ref:`troubleshooting-version-4.1`


Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

- Renaming of the ``mimetype`` app to ``mime_types``.
- Removal of the ``.api.get_mimetype`` function. The process now requires
  instantiating the configured MIME type backend and calling the
  ``get_mime_type`` method:

  .. code-block:: python

    from mayan.apps.mime_types.classes import MIMETypeBackend
    MIMETypeBackend.get_backend_instance().get_mime_type(...)

- Search model names are now specified in lower case in the user interface
  URL or in the search API URL.
