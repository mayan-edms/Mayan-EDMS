Version 4.2.10
==============

Released: August 20, 2022

Status: Maintenance


Changes
-------


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

An issue was fixed where documents uploaded via the wizard with one or
more cabinets selected, would not trigger the cabinet added event.


Storage
^^^^^^^

The ``DownloadFile`` filename was being ignored when performing the actual
download action. The filename attribute is now used if available. If it is
not available or set, the fallback value is the string representation of
the download file object.


Tags
^^^^

Similar to the document upload cabinet event issue, a tag app issue was
fixed that allows now triggering the tag attached event for documents
with a tag selected during upload.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

More verbose errors and exceptions are now displayed to console when Celery
fails to initialize.


Testing
^^^^^^^

The make file targets for staging deployments were fixed and improved.
A local ``psql`` client is not longer required to monitor the launching
of the staging PostgreSQL container. Likewise a local Redis client is no
longer needed to launch the Redis container.


Other
^^^^^

- Improve cabinet, metadata, and tag app tests.
