Version 4.3
===========

Released: July 27, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^

The Single Page App JavaScript navigation code was streamlined to remove
redundant code and use newer JavaScript paradigms. The custom HTTP response
code used for AJAX redirects can now be configure via the new setting
``APPEARANCE_AJAX_REDIRECTION_CODE``. This setting defaults to 278 for
backward compatibility.

The favicon was updated to include a thin white outline to improve
visibility when using dark themes in browsers.

The list template was updated to always show an item count, even on empty
lists. This change prevents the list toolbar from "jumping" visually when
there are no results.

The way the view title is copied to the window title was simplified.
Escaping of the title text is now performed by jQuery.


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

Support was added for cabinet mirroring. A new command with the name
``mirroring_mount_cabinet`` was added for this function. This command
work in a similar way to the command to mirror indexes. The command
creates a user space file system that will mirror the structure of the
cabinet tree structure as nested directories.


Common
^^^^^^

The initial setup and upgrade commands were refactored. All common code was
consolidated into a new command class. The code was updated to use Python's
``pathlib`` instead of performing direct path manipulation.

A new management command named ``common_generate_random_secret_key`` was
added to provide random values suitable for use as ``SECRET_KEY``.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

Support was added for transformation forms. It is no longer necessary to pass
arguments to transformation using JSON structures. Each transformation can
specify its own form which can contain standard or custom fields. In the
case of fields that reference stored objects, the field will support lists
using a dropdown selection widget.

The converter app view were separated into different modules based on usage.
One module for transformations and another for assets.

Better argument checking was added to the zoom transformation preventing
negative zoom factor values.

The calculation used to invalidate the cache of pages using an asset
transformation was fixed for all remaining edge cases.

When creating or editing redactions, the preview form will now use
a lower image layer that will not show previous redactions and will allow
seeing the entire document page. This is more natural as it gives the
impression the redaction is actually being edited by being moved instead
of showing two redactions (old in the image plus the interactive one).

The code of the transformations ``TransformationDrawRectangle`` and
``TransformationDrawRectanglePercent`` was unified into a single code base.

The transformation ``TransformationDrawRectanglePercent`` now supports
transparency. The transparency value can range from 0 to 100.

The transformations ``TransformationDrawRectangle`` and
``TransformationDrawRectanglePercent`` have been moved to the decorations
layer.

When uploading Multi-Picture Object Bitmap (MPO) images files, the converter
will take in discard any non supported child images contained in the MPO
file.

The transformation argument column was improved. Arguments are property
formatted and separated.

The transformation mixins were moved to their own module.

Subclasses using the ``APIImageViewMixin`` class can now specify the stream
MIME type via the ``.get_stream_mime_type()`` method.

When serving images using ``APIImageViewMixin``, the correct MIME type of
the data is detected before sending the stream. This ensures the image will
load correctly in all browsers that require a MIME type value in the header
of the stream.

Documents
^^^^^^^^^

The document file upload actions were converted from hardcoded logic to an
extensible class using the ``BaseBackend`` class. Available classes will be
loaded from the ``document_file_actions`` module of each app. The ID of the
class defaults to the existing literal values for compatibility.

A new API endpoint called ``document_file_actions`` was added to list the
available document file upload actions and their properties. The URL of the
API endpoint URL is: ``/api/v4/document_file_actions/``

Document version modification backend was added. The document version
page reset and append functions were converted into document version
modification backends.

The document version views and API endpoints were updated to use the document
version modification backends.

New API endpoints:

- /api/v4/documents/{ ID }/versions/{ ID }/modify/
- /api/v4/document_version_modification_backends/

The document type label fields size was increased from 96 characters to 196.

Repeated model manager definitions in the ``DocumentFilePage`` model were
removed.

Support was added for easier test document stub creation via the new
``auto_create_test_document_stub`` method. It is mutually exclusive with
``auto_upload_test_document`` and requires setting it to False.

A ``size`` field was added to the document file model. Since this value is
not expected to change, it is now a persistent model field and not calculated
on demand by querying the storage layer. This change also improves document
mirroring performance by removing one disk access per document and using
the database stored size value which is immutable.

During the upgrade the storage layer will be queried for the size of each
document file to transfer this value to the database, depending of the
number of documents and the speed of your storage this process can take
from minutes to hours or even days.

The document version export code now makes sure that the document version
pages point to an existing content object before attempting to export the
source material. Pages without a content object are skipped.

The document version export code was also updated to not assume that the
first document version page was always valid. The page loop will skip pages
with no content object and regard the first page found with a valid content
object as the first exported page.

When downloading document files, the MIME type is no longer introspected.
Instead the original values is used. This ensures correct downloads in all
cases and avoid an operation for each download.


Events
^^^^^^

A view showing all of the currently logged user's object event subscriptions
was added. This allows managing all object subscriptions from a single
location.


Indexes
^^^^^^^

The document indexing models were split into two modules. One for index
templates and another for index instances.

The document indexing code was optimized by reusing index instance nodes if
they already exists at the same level and with the same value. This operation
speeds up document indexing and reduces the number of database queries.

Support was added for document index event triggers. Historically document
indexes used hardcoded signals to trigger an index update. The indexing
app was updated to now use events to trigger these updates. This has the
additional benefits of allowing runtime configuration of the index event
triggers, disabling the ones not relevant for an index to improve
performance.

New document indexes default to update on all available document events.
Existing indexes will me automatically migrated and updated to update on all
available document events.

Index updates now support more events like adding or removing documents
from cabinets.


Logging
^^^^^^^

The error logging system received several updates.

An error log entry delete permission was added. Users need have this
permission granted either globally or for a specific object in order to be
able to delete the object's error log entries.

Support was added for deleting individual error log entries or the complete
error log of an object.

An error log entry deleted event was added.

Support was added for subscribing to the error log entry delete event of an
object.

API views were added to access the error logs of objects. The URLs are:

- /api/v4/objects/<app label>/<model name>/<object ID>/errors/
- /api/v4/objects/<app label>/<model name>/<object ID>/errors/<error entry ID>/


Messaging
^^^^^^^^^

Messages are now indexed for search. The fields indexed are: ``subject``,
``body``, and ``date_time``.


Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Permission filtering was added the notification views. This change moves
the access filtering of notification from the class to the view. Besides
removing a block of single use permission code, notifications are now
restricted when the access control is modified, even if the notification
already exists.


OCR
^^^

The OCR app was updated to use the error logging system instead of its own
error logging code and views. The permission "View error log" is now
required to view the document version OCR error log.


Parsing
^^^^^^^

The document parsing app was updated to use the error logging system instead
of its own error logging code and views. The permission "View error log" is
now required to view the document file parsing error log.

The parsing system was updated to pass the original document file to parsers
instead of attempting to pre-processing the document file to PDF. Parsers
now have access to the raw document file uploaded.

Support was added for parsing office document files and text files.


MIME types
^^^^^^^^^^

Trailing new lines are now removed from the MIME type and encoding returned
by the ``MIMETypeBackendFileCommand`` fixing all remaining edge cases.

The ``MIMETypeBackendFileCommand`` backend is now the default MIME backend.


Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``PartialNavigation.js`` code received several improvements. URL query
data is now removed on form submit and only the form's data is used as the
new URL query data. Some dead code from the module was removed. Constants
are now used where appropriate to save memory and improve speed.

The navigation code now supports AJAX request cancellation. This avoid the
user interface from appearing to be unresponsive when the backend is
overloaded. AJAX request cancellation however allows users to request more
information from the backend. To combat possible abuses the AJAX code now
throttles requests. The throttling code defaults to a maximum of 10 requests
in 5 seconds of less. This applies only to the user interface. The AJAX
throttling resets the moment the last pending AJAX request is completed.

Navigation improvements:

- Add support for anchor extra HTML attributes.
- Improve HTML data by allowing the entries to be resolved against the
  context.
- Support empty URL values. When empty, the link is rendered without a
  href attribute.


Search
^^^^^^

The search system received several updates and new features.

The biggest change is the support for list view filtering. All list views
that show instances of models with a corresponding defined search model,
will show a text box for filtering the list. The syntax is the same as the
standard simple search.

Empty list views now show the toolbar for cases where the list is empty due
to a filtering term.

The special "match-all-fields" ``q`` URL query key has been converted into a
documented literal named ``QUERY_PARAMETER_ANY_FIELD``.

Support was added for hyphenated text when using the ElasticSearch backend.
Hyphenated words are now indexed as a whole word and not split at the hyphen
location.

Similar to list filtering, REST API list filtering was added. Filtering is
done using similar logic to that of the user interface list filtering.
However, the API list filtering also supports filtering by any field and
not just using the special "any field" ``q`` query key.

The API search model names are now converted to lowercase to revert a
backward incompatible change in version 4.2. Search model names via the API
can now be specified in either lowercase (version 4.2) or hybrid case
(version <4.2).

Search model definitions are now declared with the layout "search_model..."
instead of "...search".

Support was added for removing search fields. The method is called
``.remove_search_field(search_field=)`` and requires the search field
instance obtained from the method ``.get_search_fields()``.
This allows third party apps to remove standard search fields.

The ``search_fields`` list was removed and now the ``search_fields_dict``
dictionary instead for both purposes. The canonical method to obtain the
search field of a search model is now using the method
``.get_search_fields()`` instead of accessing the private structures.

The ElasticSearch backend default settings were updated to match those of
the official Python client. This change may affect connectivity with existing
ElasticSearch server when used in clustered mode.

Support was added for showing search model fields help texts. By default the
help text from the model field will be used.

The bulk object search indexing was refactored. The task
``mayan.apps.dynamic_search.tasks.task_index_search_model`` was renamed to
``mayan.apps.dynamic_search.tasks.task_index_instances`` to better match
how it works now. The bulk index code will now index objects that actually
exists instead of using blind ID ranges.

The ``search_index_objects`` management command was updated to trigger
multiple calls to ``task_index_instances`` using small lists of instances IDs
instead of just one call with a large number of IDs. This increases the
atomicity of the indexing tasks, allowing launching more tasks that complete
faster for better resource utilization, lower query count per task and higher
indexing scalability.

Support was added for Whoosh bulk indexing using the ``BufferedWriter`` class.
When reindexing the search indexes, for every lock obtained, a group of
objects will be written as a single operation. The number of objects
written concurrently is controlled by the settings
``SEARCH_INDEXING_CHUNK_SIZE``.

Unused ``SearchModel`` methods were removed.

Sorting of ``SearchModel`` instances was improved.

The ElasticSearch backend now uses the count API to obtain accurate search
model status information.

Existing indexes are now deleted when calling the ElasticSearch backend
initialize method. This ensures complete initialization and cleanup of
existing data as the command intends.

Search backend errors are now wrapped into a search app exception alongside
a short explanation. This helps debugging search errors by providing more
context as part of the error trace.

The was the "Match all" parameter is evaluated is now normalized and
consolidated.

The evaluation of the "Match all" parameter was fixed when using a single
level scoped search.

The ``UUID`` field to ElasticSearch field mapping was changed from ``Keyword``
to ``Text`` to avoid search indexing error when processing document
ontainers with more than 910 documents. ElasticSearch's ``Keyword`` field
is limited to 32766 bytes and attempting to index a container with more
than 910 documents would exceed this limit.

The ElasticSearch backend search query configuration was updated to be more
strict and lower the number of hits a search would match. The ``match``
query was changed to ``match_phrase`` and the ``fuzzy`` query was removed.

Task retry backoff maximum delay was added to the search tasks. This avoids
abnormally running search index tasks from lingering in the message broker.


Signature captures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support was added for signature capture. The signature capture app allows
capture of handwritten signatures by digitizing pen strokes.

The original point data as well as an SVG version of the signature is stored.
The point data represents the raw signature primitives that allows reloading
them into the signature pad library. The SVG version allows for rendering as
an image for preview. A transformation was added to allow pasting a
signature as a document file or document version page image.


Sources
^^^^^^^

An ``upload`` action was added to the web form source. This allows using web
form sources to upload documents from the API.

Support was added for supplying files to source backend via the API. The
new ``accept_files`` property of the ``SourceBackendAction`` now dynamically
adds a ``file`` serializer field for the corresponding action. This expands
the types of sources third party apps can add.

The staging folder sources now inclusion and exclusion regular expressions.

Support was added for staging folder path subfolders.

The staging folder scan code was updated to use Python's ``pathlib.Path``.

Staging folders now also support pagination.

A selection link is now added to each staging folder files to make selection
easier.

The staging folder file selection input widget is now a Select2 widget
which supporting text filtering.


Storage
^^^^^^^

Support was added for disabling use of the media folder. This is controlled
with the new setting ``COMMON_DISABLE_LOCAL_STORAGE``. Changing this setting
to True will disable use of the local ``media`` folder. When using this
setting, all apps must be also configured via their respective storage
backend settings to use alternate persistence methods. This change is
important for Kubernetes deployments on providers that do not support
multiple read and write volumes such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

The ``mkdtemp`` function now accepts a ``dir`` argument like Python's
upstream version. However the ``dir`` value is appended to the system wide
value of ``STORAGE_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY``. This allows for multiple temporary
directories but keeps all temporary directories confined to the top level
temporary directory.


Tags
^^^^

The library ``django-colorful`` was removed. A standard HTML5 color field
is now used instead.

Support was added to randomize the color of a tag.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``purgeperiodictasks`` command was moved from the common app to the
task_manager app.


Templating
^^^^^^^^^^

Date manipulation template tags were added. The new tags are ``date_parse``
to convert a string into a datetime object and ``timedelta`` to apply time
transformations to a datetime object.

This change allows performing date calculation on metadata fields.


Testing
^^^^^^^

All test objects are now prefixed with an underscore to avoid possible
clashes with test methods or system test objects.

The Python package ``mock`` was removed. This package is now available as
unittest.mock in Python 3.3 and onward.


Views
^^^^^

Added support for form fieldsets. Fieldset crate groups of fields.

Fieldsets were added to the following forms:

- document file properties
- document type deletion policies
- metadata type
- user details

The pagination system was refactored. The library ``django-pure-pagination``
was removed. Django's 3.2 new ``get_proper_elided_page_range`` is now
used for pagination.

URL query pagination string manipulation was improved and duplication
removed.

The URL parameter user for pagination is now configurable. This is done via
the new setting ``VIEWS_PAGING_ARGUMENT``. This setting defaults to
``page`` for compatibility.

The default pagination size was updated from 40 items to 30.

Support for view icons was added. Icons were also added to all current views.
Every view now has a corresponding icon to be displayed next to the title.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

A new workflow action was added to send user messages. The body and the
subject support templating.

The ``WorkflowAction`` base class was updated to the consolidated base class
``common.classes.BaseBackend``.

Support was added for workflow escalation (also known as expirations). This
feature allows moving forward a workflow after the workflow has remained in
a certain state for a pre-determined amount of time.

Multiple escalations are supported for each state. Conditions using the
templating language are also supported.

The workflow API views code was unified using parent resolution mixins. This
removed repeated code and lowered the probability of future errors and/or
regressions.

A new workflow event was added called ``workflow instance created``. This
event is committed when a new workflow is launched for a document. Another
workflow event called ``workflow instance transitioned`` as also added.
This even is committed when a workflow instance is transitioned to a new
state, either manually or automatically.

When a new workflow instance is created or transitioned the corresponding
user is now tracked in the event.

Sorting and grouping of permissions in the workflow action to grant
or revoke document access was fixed and improved.
