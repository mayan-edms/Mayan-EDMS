Version 4.0.21
==============

Released: November 29, 2021

Status: Maintenance

Changes
--------

This release consists mostly of fixes and improvements backported from
version 4.1.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

The transformation ``cache_hash`` method was split into two functions to
allow sub classes to modify how the cache hash is calculated.

Added asset image cache invalidation. Changing the asset image of an existing
decoration will now invalidate the page image cache so that the new image
is used.

An a asset duplication issue was fixed.

The asset percentage position calculation was also fixed.


Docker
^^^^^^

A standalone Celery beat container was added to the default Docker Compose
file.


Lock manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improvements to the lock manager test cases were merged.


Testing
^^^^^^^

Test models now perform more strict cleanup. The test model app config cache
is cleaned after the test unit ends. All test models instances are deleted
before deleting the actual test models.


Other
^^^^^

- Add an explicit default value for ``MEDIA_URL``. Ensures forward
  compatibility with future login dependency versions.
- Move meta tags to their own partial template.
- Add libjpeg and libpng to the dev setup target.
