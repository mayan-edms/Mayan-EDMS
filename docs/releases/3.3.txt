Version 3.3
===========

Released: December 3, 2019


Changes
-------

Apps
^^^^

Three new apps are included in this release.

The file cache manager app handles filesystem caching in a reusable way.
Each file cache collection also has a maximum size limit. Once this limit
is reached the file cache will automatically delete the oldest entries.
This ensure file caches don't grow infinitely. The document and workflow apps
were updated to use the new file caching. The document image cache defaults
to 500MB and the workflow preview cache defaults to 50MB. These values can be
changed with the ``DOCUMENTS_CACHE_MAXIMUM_SIZE`` and
``WORKFLOW_IMAGE_CACHE_MAXIMUM_SIZE`` settings respectively.

The web links app allows creating links from documents to external resources.
These links are defined using the template language for variable substitution.
Web links provide a simple and fast to integrate Mayan EDMS with external
systems.

The document redactions app allows censoring private document information
in a non destructive way. Redactions are applied interactively for a documents
page. Once applied, the area will be obscured to every other part of the system.
This includes the preview and OCR systems.


Checkouts
^^^^^^^^^

Support was added for checking in and out multiple documents at a time.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

The image converter system was updated to support image layers. The first use
of this new capacity is the redactions app.


Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^

The numeric dashboard widget was updated to display numbers in local
format. This applies to decimal and thousands separators.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The command ``installjavascript`` was been renamed to ``installdependencies``.
This name better represents the function of the command.

The package ``djcelery`` was replaced by the package ``django-celery-beat``.

Celery was updated to version 4.3.0. This changes some settings:

- ``MAYAN_BROKER_URL`` to ``MAYAN_CELERY_BROKER_URL``
- ``MAYAN_CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`` to ``MAYAN_CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER``


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

The dropzone widget is now used for the document version upload form.

The document trashed event was added.

Docker
^^^^^^

The included Redis server was removed from the Docker image. A separate Redis
container must now be deployed.

Support for PIP proxying during build was added. Can be used with the local
devpi-server or other similar to speed up builds.

Celery flower was added to the Docker image. This is Celery's recommended
task monitor tool.

Several entrypoint commands were added. These are ``run_celery``,
``run_frontend``, ``run_tests``, ``run_worker``. These commands allow
running containers with a specific purpose. Adding more containers with the
``run_worker`` command is a simple way to scale up an existing installation.

All Docker scripts were updated to use the Alpine Linux versions of PostgreSQL
and Redis.

Added a ``run_command`` to the  Docker entrypoint to run arbitrary Mayan
management commands. This avoids having to use Docker's ``exec`` command.

It is now possible to specify the queue list for the ``run_worker`` Docker
command. The command accepts one of two environment variables:
``MAYAN_WORKER_NAME`` or ``MAYAN_QUEUE_LIST``. These environment variables
are only read by the ``run_worker`` command. They are not used by the rest of
the image or other commands.

The installation procedure was updated to use two Redis databases. One for
the message broker, and the other to store task results.

The default fast and medium worker concurrency was set to 0 (auto scaling).


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The documentation building dependencies are now automated as the rest of the
system dependencies.

The Sphinx sitemap extension was added to allow search engines to index all
the pages of the built documentation.


File metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support was added for wildcard MIME type associations for the file metadata
drivers.

The ``EXIFTOOL`` driver was updated to run for all documents regardless of MIME
type. Even with non image documents, this driver still provides some useful
file information.


Indexing
^^^^^^^^

An index reset tool was added. This tool erases the entire index instance, and
allows user to then rebuild a clean index from scratch.

A document template sandbox feature was added. This new feature allow testing
templates against a specify document.


Lock manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A distributed Redis lock backend was added to the lock manager app. This lock
helps keep multiple Mayan EDMS instances synchronized, even if they are running
on different hosts. This new lock requires one argument: ``redis_url``.

The ``redis_url`` argument must be added to the new ``LOCK_MANAGER_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS``
setting.

Example::

    LOCK_MANAGER_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS='{"redis_url": "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/2"}'


Mailing
^^^^^^^

The ``DjangoSMTP`` mailer password field size was increased to 192 characters.


Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^

The permission "Execute document tools" can now be granted via ACL. This
allows giving access to roles to document tools without granting the permission
globally.


Python 3
^^^^^^^^

The Docker image was updated to use Python 3. The documentation was also updated
to use Python 3.



REST API
^^^^^^^^

API endpoints were added to the document signatures app.

An API endpoint to the a document's type was added.

The OCR API submit endpoint URL was changed from::

    documents/{pk}/submit

to::

   documents/{pk}/ocr/submit


Search
^^^^^^

It is now possible to disable the simple search via the new
``SEARCH_DISABLE_SIMPLE_SEARCH`` setting.


Settings
^^^^^^^^

Support for setting migrations was added. This feature will reduce the number
of manual configuration file updates needed between upgrades.

Support for quoted configuration entries was removed. Quoted settings must now
be specified as normal nested dictionaries. Settings affected:

  - ``COMMON_SHARED_STORAGE_ARGUMENTS``
  - ``CONVERTER_GRAPHICS_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS``
  - ``DOCUMENTS_CACHE_STORAGE_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS``
  - ``DOCUMENTS_STORAGE_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS``
  - ``FILE_METADATA_DRIVERS_ARGUMENTS``
  - ``SIGNATURES_STORAGE_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS``

However migrations were added for these settings and most users will not notice
any change.

Support was added to allow user-specified location for the configuration file
with the ``CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH`` (``MAYAN_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH environment variable``),
and ``CONFIGURATION_LAST_GOOD_FILEPATH`` (``MAYAN_CONFIGURATION_LAST_GOOD_FILEPATH``
environment variable) settings. This allows setting the location of the
configuration file independently of the ``MEDIA_ROOT`` setting.

Multi database configuration is now supported. To specify multiple databases,
use the new ``MAYAN_DATABASES`` environment variable. This new setting more
closely mirrors the upstream behavior of Django.

Example::

    MAYAN_DATABASES="{'default':{'ENGINE':'django.db.backends.postgresql','NAME':'mayan','PASSWORD':'mayanuserpass','USER':'mayan','HOST':'127.0.0.1'}}"

This is the same as passing the environment variables::

    MAYAN_DATABASE_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
    MAYAN_DATABASE_NAME=mayan
    MAYAN_DATABASE_PASSWORD=mayanuserpass
    MAYAN_DATABASE_NAME=mayan
    MAYAN_DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1

This method allows specifying multiple databases such as when using replication
or sharding. It also allows for null entries such as when using Linux sockets.

Both methods (``MAYAN_DATABASE_`` prefixed entries, and single ``MAYAN_DATABASES``)
are supported.


Smart links
^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for ACLs was added to smart links.


Sources
^^^^^^^

The IMAP source was updated to work using message UIDs instead of message index.
This makes the IMAP email source for resilient and its email processing order
predictable.

Support was also added for custom IMAP search criteria. By default ``NOT DELETED``
is used to process non-deleted messages.

The IMAP source can now also execute custom ``IMAP STORE`` commands on processed
messages. The command defaults to ``+FLAGS (\\Deleted)``.

After processing IMAP message it is now possible to specify a destination
mailbox. This allows keeping processed email instead of just deleting them.

The IMAP expunge command can now be turned on or off.


Storage
^^^^^^^

The class ``FakeStorageSubclass`` was added. This placeholder class allows
serializing the real storage subclass. This prevents Django's migration
system from confusing path changes as requiring a complete database
migrations.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new vertical main menu was added. The previous main menu is now split into
two menus. One located on the left side for document related links and a new
top bar menu for system and user links. The vertical main menu remain open
even when clicking on items for faster access. Upon a browser refresh, the menu
will also restore its state to match the selected view.

The icon composition system was expanded to support icon shadows.

The Select2 widget is now used for the document type selection form. Autocomplete
is enabled for this usage.

Support was added to display help texts for view columns. By default the help
text of the corresponding model field is used and shown as a tool tip.

Is is now possible to change the system messages position using the new
``DEFAULT_MESSAGE_POSITION`` setting. The default value is ``top-right``.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

The workflow preview was improved to provide bigger, more readable previews.
The workflow state actions are now included in the preview.

Support was added for workflow context. Workflow context allows adding
variable and values to a running workflow. These variables can then be used
by the different workflow state actions.

Fields support was added to the workflow transitions. These allow adding
extra fields to capture user input. The value of the extra fields is added
to the workflow context and it is available to the workflow state actions.

A new workflow action to send automated emails was added.

The HTTP POST action received several updates. The first, add authentication
and headers support. The timeout field now supports template for dynamic timeouts.
It also now supports integers, floats, or empty values.

Another workflow action added is the document sign action. This action will
perform detached or embedded signing of a document.


Other
^^^^^

- Gunicorn now uses sync workers.
- Remove document image clear link and view. This is now handled by the file
  caching app.
- Unify all line endings to be Linux style.
- Improve document version upload form.
- Update label and icon of the document sign form
  Label updated from "Save" to "Sign".
- Rename ``document_states/tests/test_workflow_actions.py`` to
  ``document_states/tests/base.py``.
- Added ``TestServerTestCaseMixin`` to perform mocked HTTP
  requests.
- Improve ``TestModelTestMixin``. Allow specifying a base model.
  Fix passing the dynamic ``Meta`` class to the test model.
- Update ``common.http.URL`` to allow passing a query dictionary.


Removals
--------

- Database conversion. Reason for removal: The database conversions support
  provided by this feature (SQLite to PostgreSQL) was being confused with
  database migrations and upgrades.

  Database upgrades are the responsibility of the app and the framework.
  Database conversions however are not the responsibility of the app (Mayan),
  they are the responsibility of the framework.

  Database conversion is outside the scope of what Mayan does but we added
  the code, management command, instructions and testing setup to provide
  this to our users until the framework (Django) decided to add this
  themselves (like they did with migrations).

  Continued confusion about the purpose of the feature and confusion about
  how errors with this feature were a reflection of the code quality of
  Mayan necessitated the removal of the database conversion feature.

- Django environ package.
- Task inspection was removed from task manager app. This is now provided by the
  Celery Flower project.



Upgrading from a previous version

#. Update the Mayan EDMS Python package::

    sudo -u mayan |MAYAN_PIP_BIN| install mayan-edms==3.3

the requirements will also be updated automatically.


Using Git
^^^^^^^^^

#. If you installed Mayan EDMS by cloning the Git repository issue the commands::

    git reset --hard HEAD
    git pull

   otherwise download the compressed archived and decompress it overriding the
   existing installation.

#. Remove deprecated requirements::

    pip uninstall -y -r removals.txt

#. Next upgrade/add the new requirements::

    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt


Common steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perform these steps after updating the code from either step above.

#. Make a backup of your supervisord file::

       sudo cp |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF| |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|.bck

#. Update the supervisord configuration file. Replace the environment
   variables values show here with your respective settings. This step will refresh
   the supervisord configuration file with the new queues and the latest
   recommended layout::

       sudo sh -c "MAYAN_DATABASE_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql MAYAN_DATABASE_NAME=mayan \
       MAYAN_DATABASE_PASSWORD=mayanuserpass MAYAN_DATABASE_USER=mayan \
       MAYAN_DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1 MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| platformtemplate supervisord > |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|"

   or::

       sudo sh -c "MAYAN_DATABASES=\"{'default':{'ENGINE':'django.db.backends.postgresql','NAME':'mayan','PASSWORD':'mayanuserpass','USER':'mayan','HOST':'127.0.0.1'}}\" \
       MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| platformtemplate supervisord > |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|"

#. Edit the supervisord configuration file and update any setting specific to your installation::

       sudo vi |MAYAN_SUPERVISOR_CONF|

#. Migrate existing database schema with::

       sudo -u mayan MAYAN_DATABASE_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql MAYAN_DATABASE_NAME=mayan \
       MAYAN_DATABASE_PASSWORD=mayanuserpass MAYAN_DATABASE_USER=mayan \
       MAYAN_DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1 MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
       |MAYAN_BIN| performupgrade

   or::

       sudo -u mayan MAYAN_DATABASES="{'default':{'ENGINE':'django.db.backends.postgresql','NAME':'mayan','PASSWORD':'mayanuserpass','USER':'mayan','HOST':'127.0.0.1'}}" \
       MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
      |MAYAN_BIN| performupgrade


#. Add new static media::

       sudo -u mayan MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT=|MAYAN_MEDIA_ROOT| \
