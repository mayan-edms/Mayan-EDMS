Version 4.1.2
=============

Released: October 27, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------

Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An bug was fixed where an empty ``ORGANIZATIONS_URL_BASE_PATH`` value
would cause the work ``None`` to be appended to the URL after login.


Templating
^^^^^^^^^^

An issue that cause ``initial_help_text`` of ``ModelTemplateField`` to be
ignored was fixed.

The issue that prevented the creation of a Document version page OCR update
workflow action was rooted in the way the ``ModelTemplateField`` passed
the model value to the widget, which caused Django to attempt getting a
string representation of the model. The issue was fixed for all tested
cases.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

The ``ModelTemplateField`` was added to the document properties modification
and the HTTP request workflow actions.

The first stage of the workflow action help text consolidation was merged.
