Version 4.0.23
==============

Released: November 13, 2022

Status: End of life

Changes
--------


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

Ensure cabinet document is added using the correct method when using the
upload wizard.



Docker
^^^^^^

The Debian container was updated from tag 10.10-slim to 10.13-slim.

Docker images are no longer tagged ``latest`` for minor releases. As per
Docker's specification, the ``latest`` tag is applied to the latest image
built if no tag is specified. It is not meant to represent the latest version
of an project, just the last image that has been built.

However users commonly (and mistakenly) have come to expect the ``latest``
tag to represent the latest version of the project. The GitLab CI file was
updated to match this expectation.


Search
^^^^^^

Add help text to the ``SEARCH_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS`` setting.


Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^

Fix statistic queue view navigation context.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Display exception errors to console when Celery fails to initialize.
