Version 4.2.4
=============

Released: April 29, 2022

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

Trashed documents are now filtered from the cabinet document retrieval
methods. This brings code parity with tag documents which work in a very
similar way.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

The LUT values used when masking an asset for pasting via Pillow's
``point()`` are now typecasted to integer which is what the function
expects.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated the Debian Docker image from version 11.2-slim to 11.3-slim.


Downgraded the Python Docker image from version 3.11-slim to 3.10-slim.

Pin Jinja2 version to workaround Sphinx bug. Sphinx Jinja2 dependency is
not pinned or immutable, and causes the installation of an incompatible
version breaking builds.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes the paths to the OTP backends shown in the documentation.


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added community contributed Portainer installation files and documentation
chapter.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

Improved the document metadata edit form validation.


The ``disabled`` attribute was removed from the metadata type label field to
avoid having its value removed after a refresh when there is a validation
error.

Removed the ``required`` flag from the value field when there is a required
metadata for a document. The previous behavior cause the tabular form to
display "(required)" in column title confusing users and causing them to
think that all metadata type fields were required.

Validation errors are now raised for specific required metadata entries and
not for the entire form. This help users better understand which metadata
field needs to be corrected.

Improved the required metadata validation logic to take into account
existing values and empty forms when data was entered into the field
but the update checkbox was left unchecked.


Python
^^^^^^

Improved Python 3.10 compatibility by adding a compatibility module to
encapsulate import of the ``Iterable`` class.


Search
^^^^^^

Removed the hardcoded search model variable name from the ``search_box.html``
template. The variable name is now extracted via a template tag to ensure
backward compatibility even if the variable name is updated again in the
future.

Fixed the search model API URL reference by having the API and view use
the same variable to reference the search model.

Used the ``SEARCH_MODEL_NAME_KWARG`` instead of hard coding the search model
API URL reference.

Retry failed bulk indexing tasks.

Add max retry value to ``task_index_search_models``.

Added improved search tasks error logging.


Tags
^^^^

Trashed documents are now filtered from the tag document count column.


Other
^^^^^

- Fix Docker pull counter.
- Remove repeated Whoosh backend line of code from merge.
