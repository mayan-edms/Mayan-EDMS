Release notes
=============

Release notes for the official **Mayan EDMS** releases. Each release note will tell you
what's new in each version, and will also describe any backwards-incompatible
changes made in that version.

For those upgrading to a new version of **Mayan EDMS**, you will need to check
all the backwards-incompatible changes and deprecated features for
each 'final' release from the one after your current **Mayan EDMS** version,
up to and including the latest version.
