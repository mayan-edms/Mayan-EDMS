Version 4.1
===========

Released: October 10, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


General
^^^^^^^

The code used to detect open file and descriptor leak detection was improved
and made more strict. New descriptor leaks were fixed.

File descriptors created after inspecting a Django file field (even if the
file is not opened) are now explicitly managed and closed.

Context managers are now used for temporary files and directories. This
ensures file descriptors are closed and freed up in all scenarios even
exception errors.

The final uses of the ``.six`` library were removed.

The ``performupgrade`` command was updated to not hide critical errors and
instead raise any exception to obtain the maximum amount of debug
information.

Whenever applicable, the use of the ``sorted`` function was replace with
the ``.sort`` method to reduce memory usage.


ACLs
^^^^

The ACL edited event is now triggered only once when all permissions are
changed.

The action object of the ACL edited event is now the content object and
not the permission being added or removed.


Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^

The theme stylesheet sanitization process was moved to the ``.save()``
method. This improves performance when themes are used.

A setting was added to allow changing to menu polling interval. The value
is specified in milliseconds with `None` used to disable polling.


Comments
^^^^^^^^

The comments API was updated to exclude trashed documents. The serializers
in use were reduced by consolidation. The API permission filter was updated
to return error 404 and not 403 on insufficient access for function parity
with the rest of the API.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

Image generation in all apps was consolidated to a common core which is then
expanded and customized by the apps. As part of this consolidation settings
and internal literals used by external app were merged or removed.
The settings ``DOCUMENT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_FILE_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY``
and  ``DOCUMENT_TASK_GENERATE_DOCUMENT_VERSION_PAGE_IMAGE_RETRY_DELAY`` were
removed as the image generation task now uses exponentially incrementing
retry delays. App specific image generation task queues were removed.
This includes the ``document_states_fast`` task queue.

The setting ``CONVERTER_IMAGE_GENERATION_MAX_RETRIES`` was added to control
how many times the image generation task will retry lock errors before raising
an error and giving up.

The unification of the image generation also allows the use of streaming
responses when serving images. Streaming responses allow offloading the
actual transfer of data to the application and web server. This results
is faster response times, faster image transfers, lower CPU and memory usage.


Dashboards
^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to create multiple dashboards. These are created at the
app level and can be reused by other apps.

A new user dashboard was added to reflect Mayan's nature as a multi user
system. The new default user dashboard tracks the documents relevant
documents for quick access. The previous dashboard has been renamed as the
"administrator dashboard" as it shows a consolidated view of the entire
installation.

A tool was added to allow accessing all defined dashboards.

Support was also added for selecting the default dashboard for display in the
home view.

A new dashboard widget was added to allow displaying a list of objects.

The dashboard widget class was interface was updated to allow subclassing
existing widget classes.

Dashboard CSS was moved from the appearance app to the dashboards app.

Support for disabling the home page dashboard was added. Used to disable
the home view dashboard during tests.

Documents
^^^^^^^^^

The API was updated to exclude trashed documents from all endpoints. A new
endpoint was added to serve trashed documents.

A new ``valid`` model managers was added for recently accessed,
recently created, and favorite documents. These managers exclude trashed
documents at the model level. The ``objects`` manager for these model
returns the unfiltered queryset.

The trashed document delete API now returns a 202 code instead of 204. The
delete method now runs in the background in the same way as the trashed
document delete view works in the user interface. The return code was
updated to reflect this internal change.

Better user tracking for trashed document events was added.

Support was added to append all document file pages as a single document
version.

The UUID field of all document child objects was added as a search field.

Stricter checks were added to ensure the name and not the path of a file
is used during upload.

Compressed files can include path references, these are now scrubbed and
only the filename of the file in the compressed archive is used.

Signals, hooks, and events were moved outside of the document file creation
database transaction. These are only triggered when the transaction is
committed.

When using the document version page reset and remap action the current user
is capture for the events.

Conditionals were added to the favorite document links to ensure they only
active when relevant.

The recently accessed document list now has a new column showing the data
and time of the last access.

The text message sent to users to notify them that a document has been
exported is now translated into the locale of the user and not of the system.

The way the document resolution settings are used has been updated.
There are four resolutions specified by the documents app: ``thumbnail``,
``preview``, ``display``, and ``print``. The ``display`` resolution is
the highest one meant for detailed viewing of a document's page. This view
allows interactive transformations like zooming and rotation at the highest
quality level.

Previously, the view showing the document page images was using the
``display`` resolution. Since document pages in this view cannot be zoomed
or interactively transformed, the extra resolution and added image processing
was not fully utilized. In this version, this view now uses the ``preview``
resolution.

To continue displaying the images in the document preview window at the
previous resolution, set the values of the ``DOCUMENTS_PREVIEW_WIDTH`` and
``DOCUMENTS_PREVIEW_HEIGHT`` setting to match the values of the
``DOCUMENTS_DISPLAY_WIDTH`` and ``DOCUMENTS_DISPLAY_HEIGHT`` settings.


Docker
^^^^^^

The use of Docker Compose profiles added in version 4.0 was expanded to allow
more deployment options. By default a single container running the entire
stack. However the same Docker Compose file can launch independent workers
and frontend containers.


Events
^^^^^^

Support was added for clearing the event list. This feature works for all the
different event views.

All events are now preloaded at bootup. This allow all events to be
recognized even if they are not used and does not rely on imports to activate
an event.

Events can now be loaded by their name. This avoids doing direct imports when
there are circular dependencies.

The events app was moved to the top of the installed apps list to allow it to
preload all events.

The event clear and event export links are now only displayed for object
whose events can be cleared and/or exported.

The events app API was updated to return error 404 on insufficient
permissions.

The event registrations for several models was adjusted:

- Register cabinet document add and remove events to the Document model too.
- Register document file parsing events to the Document model too.
- Rename label of the document parsed content deleted event.
- Replace the ``DownloadFile`` content object registration from the
  ``Document`` model to the ``DocumentVersion`` model.
- Register the document file created, edited events to the ``Document``
  model too.
- Register the document version created, edited events to the ``Document``
  model too.
- Register the document trashed event to the ``Document`` model too.
- Remove the document file created event from the ``DocumentFile`` model.
- Remove the document version created event from the ``DocumentVersion``
  model.
- Register the document version page deleted event to the
  ``DocumentVersion`` model.
- Remove the document version page deleted event from the
  ``DocumentVersionPage`` model.
- Register the tag attached, removed events to the ``Document`` model too.
- Register the web link navigated event to the ``Document`` model too.
- Remove the document version page OCR edited event from the ``Document``
  model.
- Register the document version OCR submitted, finished, content deleted
  events to the ``DocumentVersion`` model.

These event adjustments removed some obsolete model interactions. These also
allow new subscriptions and workflow triggers.


Indexing
^^^^^^^^

The index instance node value field was updated to be an unique field among
its own tree level. This prevents tree corruption under heavy load.

The partial distributed indexing algorithm was replaced with a linear
algorithm. The previous algorithm was very fast but suffered from a complete
retry if there was a locking error in one of the tree levels during update.
The new algorithm is slower in theory as it locks the entire tree, but in
practice is more efficient because there are less lock collisions.

Locking the entire tree along with new database integrity changes, further
reduces the chances of index tree corruption.

The new algorithm also allows very quick removals using a single query
operation as opposed to the previous looped locking. Additions are also now
performed using forward related through field managers which permit adding
values to many to many fields using a single query instead of a Python loop.

The change in the algorithm required the API to also be updated. Each tree
level node returns an URL to list view of its respective children. This
change also enabled the switch to a paged API for the index instance.

Index instance columns were updated to be more consistent in their
information. New columns were added with additional information. The ordering
of the columns was also made consistent between the top level index instance
view and the index instance node navigation views.

The document indexing API was updated to exclude trashed documents.

The indexing task was updated to use exponential retry delays with a maximum
retry backoff delay of 60 seconds.


Mailing
^^^^^^^

The mailing app was refactored to support all document features introduced in
version 4.0.

It is now possible to mail document files and document versions as
attachments as well as links. Documents can only be shared over email as
links.

The workflow action was updated to send a link to the document or send
the active version of the document as attachment.

The app icons were updated to make the more intuitive.


Metadata
^^^^^^^^

The API permission layout was updated to match the one of the user interface
views. The edit or view permission is now required for the document type
as well as the metadata type.

API serializers were unified and redundant code removed.

The metadata type form tab order was improve. The metadata type name field
is now disabled via CSS to skip it during data entry when using tabs.

Support was added for deleting multiple metadata types in a single action.


Messaging
^^^^^^^^^

This version adds the API for the messaging app.

Super users and staff users are now excluded from being message recipients.

A dedicated create message form was added with improved widgets and widget
attributes.

Select2 is now used for the user selection field.

The message edit permission was added. This permission is required in order
to change the message read status.


Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^

The navigation classes were refactored and several important patches merged.

Request and context resolution was unified for all navigation app classes.

Support was added for retrieving a list of ``SourceColumn`` by name.

The ``SourceColumn.get_for_source`` was refactored for better and faster
object resolution. Some navigation object would include child or proxy
objects in the resolution of the parent object navigation while other
excluded them and required explicit inclusion. This logic has been unified
to default to inclusion. All exclusion must now be explicit.

The views ``resolved_object`` is now passed as an argument to the link's
display conditions callback. While the view context is still passed to the
callback, the ``resolved_object`` argument makes determining the active
object using the context unnecessary. The context is still provided for link
conditions that are dependent on other values in the view context.

Link de-duplication was added to links that are part of the same menu.

The helper function ``get_cascade_condition`` was renamed to
``factory_condition_queryset_access`` which better reflects its purpose.

Support was added for exclusion during menu link binding.

Callback support was added to ``factory_condition_queryset_access``.

Support for proxy model exclusions was added.


OCR
^^^

Support for editing the document version page OCR content was added.
This work via the user interface and the API.


Parsing
^^^^^^^

Support was added to allow deleting the parsed content of multiple files
as a single action.


Platform
^^^^^^^^

Support was added for service client backends. These are clients for
specialized services operating outside Mayan EDMS.

A service client for Sentry.io was added to allow production exception
tracking.

The settings ``PLATFORM_CLIENT_BACKEND_ENABLED`` and
``PLATFORM_CLIENT_BACKEND_ARGUMENTS`` are used to pass argument such as
credentials to the service backends and select which are to be launched as
startup.


REST API
^^^^^^^^

The settings ``REST_API_MAXIMUM_PAGE_SIZE`` and ``REST_API_PAGE_SIZE`` were
added to allow controlling the default page size and the maximum page size
of the result responses.

The ``get_absolute_api_url`` method was added to download files,
document versions and users. These URLs are used to determine the message
sender's API URL.

Batch API request support added. These allow sending multiple API requests
inside a single HTTP request. Items of a batch API request can also share
their responses to allow for advanced API automation.


Roles
^^^^^

Support was added for deleting multiple roles in a single action.


Search
^^^^^^

The ``TASK_RETRY_DELAY`` setting was remove and exponential retry used
instead.

The query string is now sanitized and non valid search criteria removed.

The Whoosh backend received many updates. While it is still not the default
search backend, this version moves that goal closer.

The Whoosh backend can now reindexing object after related many to many
fields values are removed or added. Support for indexing multiple many to
many field values as independent values was also added.

The default behavior of the search system was to work as a filter and remove
values from the total based on the search query. This caused search results
to be inclusive, adding results that were not relevant to the query. The
behavior was updated to work like a search filter. Incorrect search queries
will now return an empty result set.

Several operation like query processing were moved to the base class reducing
the amount of code in the search backends.


Signatures
^^^^^^^^^^

The API was updated to exclude trashed documents.

When a signature file is uploaded, the current user is captured and used
for the event.

A new event was added to track detached signature deletion.


Sources
^^^^^^^

The sources app was refactored. This refactor remove model inheritance, makes
sources work like backends, and allow external app to create their own
sources.

The refactor also allows object level permission to be applied to sources
which means sources now support ACLs. A default requirement was added to
sources, they required the document create permission. This permission must
be explicitly granted for new or existing sources.

File locking support was remove from the staging folder uploads. File locking
did not prevented incomplete files to be processed.

The sources API now work by having a common set of CRUD operations for all
sources while also allowing the sources to register their own unique
functionality as source actions. Example of this is the staging folder file
preview and staging folder file upload actions.

The refactor also allows unifying background tasks. Sources can now also
define callbacks that are executed after the document is created to allow
add or changing document attributes in an asynchronous manner.

Support for recoding email Message ID was added. The email source can now
record an email Message ID from the header as it is processed into documents.
All documents created from the same email will have the same Message ID.

Support was added to rewind the step of the upload wizard.


Smart links
^^^^^^^^^^^

The API was updated to exclude trashed documents.

The resolved smart link API and serializer were refactored to modernize the
implementation.

A permission requirement was added to view resolved smart links. This
permission needs to be granted for the smart link and for the
document/document type.

The API was updated to return error 404 on insufficient access.


Tags
^^^^

The tag color value was added as a search field.


Tasks
^^^^^

Celery workers are now launched with the options ``--without-gossip`` and
``--without-heartbeat`` to reduce chatter and broker resources.


Testing
^^^^^^^

The test view mixin was updated to support multiple test views per test case.
It is now possible to passing arguments to the ``.add_test_view()`` method.

Test view mixin subclasses can now supply their own ``urlpatterns``. This is
used to allow creation of API test views with minimal scaffolding.


Translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Spanish locale was split into Spanish (Puerto Rico) and Spanish.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choice forms now support real-time filtering of items. These forms are used
in the add/remove views of groups, roles, ACLs, indexes, and smart links.

Support was added for overriding form buttons. This is important for
integrators wanting to add not just additional form button but also remove
the default submit button.

Custom submit button label and submit button icons were removed from most
views. These are still supported but their usage reduced for a more
consistent user experience.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

Changing the document type of a document will now cause the workflows for
the new document type to be launched automatically.

Event subscriptions was enabled for workflow states, workflow state actions,
and workflow transitions.

Using workflows as source for indexes was improved.

Upgrade process
---------------

.. important::

  If using a direct deployment, Supervisord must be upgraded to version
  4.2.2. See troubleshooting section: :ref:`troubleshooting-version-4.1`


.. include:: partials/upgrade-3.5-4.0.txt


Troubleshooting
---------------

Follow the solutions outlined in the troubleshooting section:
:ref:`troubleshooting-version-4.1`


Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

Using a source now requires a permission. The document create permission must
be granted now not only for the document type but also for a source in order
to be able to upload new documents.

To be able to use a source to upload new document files to an existing
document, the new document file permission must also be granted for the
source.

A permission requirement was added to view resolved smart links. This
permission needs to be granted for the smart link and for the
document/document type.

Trashed documents are now excluded from all API endpoints.

Superusers and staff users are now excluded from being message recipients.

The message edit permission was added. This permission is required in order
to change the message read status.

Due to the changes in the index tree generation algorithm and database
integrity configuration, existing index trees will deleted during upgrade
and need to be rebuild after upgrade.

Environment variable ``MAYAN_GUNICORN_JITTER`` renamed to
``MAYAN_GUNICORN_REQUESTS_JITTER``.
