Version 4.1.1
=============

Released: October 26, 2021

Status: Stable

Changes
-------


Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^

The sidebar menu heading display logic was improved. In some views and
with some specific combination of objects, link headings were sometimes
not shown. This was fixed for all reported cases.

Some HTML markup left over by a merge in the server error dialog window was
removed.

The X style close button for the server error dialog breaks the visual
pattern of the rest of the dialogs and was removed.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^

The layer exclusion error caused by the asset image generation in version 4.1
was fixed.


Docker
^^^^^^

The variables ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` and ``COMPOSE_PROFILES`` were moved
to the correct file, the ``.env`` file.


Other
^^^^^

- Merged fixes and improvements from versions 4.0.17 and 4.0.18.
- Update PIP from version 21.2.4 to 21.3.1.
- Remove MySQL upgrade CD/CI testing pipeline stage until support is properly
  re-implemented for version 8.0.
- Add CD/CI triggers for local testing.
- Exclude all migration tests by tagging automatically at the
  ``MayanMigratorTestCase`` subclass definition.
- Support multiple environments per dependency.
- Update the ``wheel`` library to be a dependency of the ``build`` and the
  ``documentation`` environments to workaround a bug in PIP that causes
  ``"error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'"``.
